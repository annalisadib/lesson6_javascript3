### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Learned about and how to use the functions necissary to create a dynamic HTML page. In this lesson, we used specific code to create an image carousel. We implimented the use of a right and left arrow. We also created a button that loads additional images.
2. Learned about DOM, or Document Object Model. Using DOM gives JavaScript the ability to change every element of an HTML page. In DOM all elements are called objects. Within those objects are properties and methods which are each responsible for carrying out a different function, like changing or adding an element.
3. Learned about and how to attached DOM Nodes to the DOM Tree. Each created node is independet from the DOM tree, but can be attached using the methods function. Once attached, the words "true" or "false" are used to close the ndoes depending on whether the node is a child or parent.
